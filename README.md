This web app extends the lecture demo by implementing the "forgot password" functionality. <br>
A new Gmail account was created and used for this app.<br>
To use "forgot password" functionality, the user needs to edit his actual gmail account information in WEB-INF/web.xml and replace "youremail@gmail.com" and "password" with actual address and password <br>
